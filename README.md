libgcrypt example code beginner level

In encrypt_decrypt.c we have a complete cryptography exemple.
To ensure the data is secure, we begin by crypting the data
packing the encrypted data in a standardized format  
and finally sign all the packed data.

the inverse procedure is performed while decrypting the data.

In jecrypt.c a more simpler approch is used
we just crypted and packed the data
